## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML and CSS, and Iâ€™m planning to dive into JavaScript and React next. ğŸš€

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on front-end projects (especially anything related to UI components, layouts, or responsiveness). Open-source projects are my jam! ğŸ˜„

ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with staying updated with new web development trends, working with APIs and integrations, and improving my code organization. Would love to hear any tips!

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my journey into front-end development, best practices for HTML/CSS, or how I approach learning new web technologies. I'm happy to share my experience and insights!

ğŸ“« How to reach me: gmm.works@proton.me or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guilherme-miranda-de-morais/)


âš¡ Fun fact: Eu adoro aprender novas tecnologias, e sou fascinado por como o design e a programaÃ§Ã£o podem se unir para criar experiÃªncias incrÃ­veis na web!
