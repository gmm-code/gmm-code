## Hi there 👋

🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS, and I’m planning to dive into JavaScript and React next. 🚀

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on front-end projects (especially anything related to UI components, layouts, or responsiveness). Open-source projects are my jam! 😄

🤔 I’m looking for help with staying updated with new web development trends, working with APIs and integrations, and improving my code organization. Would love to hear any tips!

💬 Ask me about my journey into front-end development, best practices for HTML/CSS, or how I approach learning new web technologies. I'm happy to share my experience and insights!
